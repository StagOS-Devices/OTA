March 15 Changelog

Hello there guys, it's lovely to be able to pass on another changelog after soo long. I haven't been able to update the original feature list, I'm still working on it but here I bring you the changes for this build.

Firstly thank you very much for giving such a positive response to the initial release of Stag, we still hope to maintain that trust you have in us, with all the features we always had without any compromise of stability.

We have a couple of announcements to make which I will at the end of the post.

The Changelog

Updated to March Security Patch
Improved FaceUnlock Implementation (Should be amazing now try it to see it, Thanks to Jhenrique)
Improved gapps package (Now Gapps has everything you could ask for)
Replaced music player with Retro Music Player
Improved Ambient display options (as below)
Added double tap to Ambient/wake up
Add option to show AOD on charge
Pulse/Edge light for notifications
Added Smart Charging (for supported devices)
Added lock screen charging status
Added option to invert navbar (both 2-button and 3-button)
Added smart Pixels
Added battery bar
Added pulse and edge light notification
Added long screenshot (I can't believe I delayed it soo much)
Kill an app from its notification (you heard me right long tap and close app right there)
Headers (We all missed our very own stag headers didn't we)
Added Permission Hub (For the privacy enthusiast in us)
Set a dead zone above which gestures won't work (For US butterfingers)
Customize the length of the gesture nav bar now
Who likes the lock icon, disable it if you want to :P
On the final note:

The build should ideally come over OTA, if for some reason OTA doesn't work we'd request you to please follow the flashing instructions of your respective device.

Thank You for being with us :)

Coming to our announcements

We have a few new devices that added

Nokia 6.1 
OnePlus 6/6t (Back with a swing)
Realme 1
Realme U1
We are on the lookout for intuitive designs for our Horns app

You don't need to code it, as long as you can show it and we like it we'll do the code and make sure the credit of the design is well deserved.

So what are you waiting for all the people with ideas burst on the main group, looking forward to cool designs
